This app is pretty much self explained by intuitive design - no user manual needed. ðŸ“š

If you would like to fork this project and adjust the code your needs, just clone it,
install all dependencies by `npm i` and finally run `npm run dev` -
the app then should be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)!
